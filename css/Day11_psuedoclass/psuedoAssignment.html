        <p>The Charminar is a monument located in Hyderabad,
              Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a 
              symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the
              emblem of Telangana.The Charminar's long history 
              includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for 
              more than 425 years. While both historically and 
              religiously significant, it is also known for its popular 
              and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has 
              become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad.</p>
